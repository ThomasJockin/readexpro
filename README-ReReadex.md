# Disclaimer
This project exists only to improve compatibility and ease of use for software that doesn't support easily switching to alternative glyphs. Lokxend & ReReadex Pro are completely based on [Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/) and [Readex Pro](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro) but are in no way related to them; Lokxend & ReReadex have different names to avoid confusion and to facilitate finding them (typing (`LE` ≠ `LO`)(`REA` ≠ `RER`)).
