# Lexend is a variable font empirically shown to significantly improve reading-proficiency.

As prescription eyeglasses achieve proficiency for persons with short-sightedness, Lexend employs variable font technology to prescribe a personalized axis setting according to the Shaver-Troup Formulations.

> ![](https://thomasjockin.github.io/lexend/static/images/noordzji-cover-cut.png) The word is the condition for reading. The word consists of both white and black forms in rhythm units. If the rhythm is weak; the word is poorly formed. If the rhythm is absent; there is no word. Reading is a spatial manner of intervals in both length and breadth.... Ignoring the white by pedagogy places civilization at risk. What is civilization if not the cultural community dependent on reading?

###### Excerpts from “The Stroke” by Gerrit Noordzij

# The US Department of Education reports that **only <AnimatedNumber key="us-dept-of-ed">36</AnimatedNumber>% of students are reading-proficient.** This would appear to confirm Noordzij’s hyperbolic warning.

## Reading-Proficiency is measured in fluency.

There is a consensus that reading fluency is one of the defining characteristics of good readers, and a lack of fluency is a common characteristic of poor readers.

Differences in reading fluency not only distinguish good readers from poor, but a lack of reading fluency is also a reliable predictor of reading comprehension problems. Once struggling readers learn sound-symbol relationships through intervention and become accurate decoders, their lack of fluency emerges as the next hurdle they face on their way to reading proficiency.

This lack of fluent reading is a problem for poor readers because they tend to read in a labored, disconnected fashion with a focus on decoding at the word level that makes comprehension of the text difficult, if not impossible.

## Fluency is measured in Words Correct Per Minute.

A student reads a story with <TotalNumberOfWords/> words in <TotalAmountOfTime/>. She made <TotalNumberOfErrors/> errors. To determine WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute):

1. <p>Count the total number of words.</p>
  <pre><code><TotalNumberOfWords/> words</code></pre>
2. <p>Count the number of mistakes.</p>
  <pre><code><TotalNumberOfErrors/> mistakes</code></pre>
3. <p>Take the number of words minus the number of mistakes = number of words read correctly.</p>
  <pre><code><TotalNumberOfWords/> words - <TotalNumberOfErrors/> mistakes = <TotalNumberOfCorrectWords/> correct words</code></pre>
4. <p>Convert the time it took to read the passage to seconds.</p>
  <pre><code><TotalAmountOfTime/> to read = <TotalAmountOfTime as="seconds"/>s</code></pre>
5. <p>Convert the number of seconds to a decimal by dividing the number of seconds by 60. This is the total reading time.</p>
  <pre><code><TotalAmountOfTime as="seconds"/>s / 60 = <TotalAmountOfTime as="decimal"/> total reading time</code></pre>
6. <p>Divide the number of words read correctly by the total reading time in decimal form.</p>
  <pre><code><TotalNumberOfCorrectWords/> / <TotalAmountOfTime as="decimal"/> = <TotalWordsCorrectPerMinute/> Words Correct per Minute (WCPM)</code></pre>

## The Shaver-Troup Formulations

As an Educational Therapist, Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup observed that reading issues masked the individual’s true capability and intelligence. Shaver-Troup theorized that these issues were a sensitivity to typographical factors. She began manipulating multiple text factors to find a match between text format and an individual’s optimized visual processing capabilities.

In clinical practice with both children and adults, Dr. Shaver-Troup used a fluency test to measure the effectiveness of the solution. Test results supported her theory; making the modifications to typography allowed the reader to instantaneously improve Words Correct per Minute (WCPM) scores, which research correlates to increased comprehension.

### The Shaver-Troup Formulations Examined
Three factors were manipulated in increasing intensity. These factors were:

- Hyper expansion of character spacing
- Expanded font-outline shapes
- Sans-serif font to reduce noise

### The Demonstration of Effectiveness

20 third graders, eight males and twelve females, read for one minute in five fonts.

All text was set at 16pt and the reading materials were two grade levels above the participants current grade level to ensure the typography was being measured, rather than reading competency.

Each student read out loud a passage set in a control of Times New Roman, then four of the Lexend Series — Regular, Deca, Mega, and Giga.

## A Virtue of Variable Font Technology

As the study demonstrates, while the Lexend series were beneficial to a large sample of students, no one setting worked best for all students. Diverse readers need different axis settings like people require different eyeglass prescriptions.

Eyeglass prescriptions are not six strict settings. There are more granular settings possible.

Variable font technology allows for continuous selection of the Lexend Series to find the specific setting for an individual student.

# Speculative Interlude

At the end of the 2018 project, Thomas identified research by Dr. Nadine Chahine on reading proficiency in Arabic. The conclusion and implication of her research support the reasonable proposal to apply the Shaver-Troup Formulation into an Arabic variable font.

Aspects of hyper-extension are already familiar in Arabic. The lengthening of text for justification is named kashida which can aid in legibility:

>The kashida is used to give a better character layout on the baseline, and to lessen the cluttering at the joint point between two successive letters of the same word

###### Mohamed Jamal Eddine Benatia,Mohamed Elyaakoubi and Azzeddine Lazrek  [Source](http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb27-2/tb87benatia.pdf)

Working with Dr. Chahine and support from Google, the Lexend team wishes to investigate if the Shaver-Troup Formulations applied to the Arabic script has the same beneficial fluency properties as we have demonstrated in the Latin script. If proven true, the implications are the following:

- A richer understanding of human perception that is cross-cultural in scope
- Demonstration of evidence-based design practices in regard to legibility
- A contribution to expanding reading-proficiency around the world
